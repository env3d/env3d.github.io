I have completely redesigned the env3d website.  Besides looking way better, I have also included complete lessons on how to use env3d in CS1.  You can find them under the "Learn" section of the website.<br /><br />A new version of env3d is also available.  A couple of major changes:<br /><br /> * No need to "install" the extension anymore.  Simply download and open the blank project, and follow the lessons to add your own code.<br /><br /> * You can now create 3D-accelerated applets for online distribution.<br /><br />If you like env3d or have questions or comments, feel free to drop me a line.
