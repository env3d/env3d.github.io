Well, I have just finished using env3d in my first year class.  Feedbacks from students are very positive.  I have also learned a lot about designing a good API and have been making changes to env3d through each assignment.  Lots of work but I think the results are worth it.  Here are some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/jasonmadar">students videos</a> on youtube.<br /><br />I'm now working on using env3d in the follow-up course which teaches inheritance and software design.  A few new improvements are already in CVS, the most notable being a new EnvCanvas class for use in GUI applications, a new EnvObject base class, and a new EnvObjectInterface.  These new classes will (hopefully) be used to illustrate the usefulness of an inheritance hierarchy.
