Very exciting news -- Over Christmas, one of my students, Kenny, decided to create a community website for Env3D.  The result is http://env3d.org.  This new site has lots of features, including community forums, applet sharing, and all of the lessons from the old sourceforge site.<br /><br />Enjoy the new site and give us some feedback on our forum!
