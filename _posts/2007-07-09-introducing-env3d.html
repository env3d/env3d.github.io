I created env3d to help with my introductory Java course. The internal 3d engine was written a couple of years ago to help me learn OpenGL.  Since then, I have been trying to find a way to apply some real-time 3d graphics into my teaching.<br /><br />What I am planning to do is to cover the first 7 chapters of the <a href="http://www.bluej.org/help/textbook.html">bluej textbook</a> using env3d as a tool for in-class demonstration and projects.  That's why you'll find that I have used <span style="font-style: italic;">java reflection</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">interface </span>for all 3d objects definitions in my examples.<br /><br />Env3d is free (under GPL).  Please try it out and let me know what you think.  I would really appreciate some feedback before I start using it this Fall.
