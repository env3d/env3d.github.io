<a href="http://www.vandrico.com/" target="_blank">Vandrico</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/van-android-developers/" target="_blank">Vancouver Android Developer</a> meetup group is hosting an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/van-android-developers/events/116665752/" target="_blank">env3d meetup</a> on June 5, 2013.&nbsp; I will be doing a small presentation followed by hands-on demo on how to create play store ready android apps using env3d.&nbsp; If you live in the Greater Vancouver area, we would love to have you come out and meet us in person, try out the development tools, and chat over beers!&nbsp;
